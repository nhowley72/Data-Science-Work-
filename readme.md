# Data-Science-Work

Welcome to the **Data-Science-Work** repository! This repository is a collection of resources, code, and documents related to data science, machine learning, and data visualization from my Undergraduate Degree at the University of Bath where I studied Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science.

 It is organized to support various data science projects and provide foundational resources for learning and development.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Dissertation**: Contains my Dissertation in the Applications and Limitations of Pyhics Informed Neural Networks.

- **Python - Data Science**: Contains code, notebooks, and scripts specifically focused on data science concepts, such as data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis.
  
- **Python - Machine Learning**: Focuses on machine learning models and algorithms implemented in Python. This folder includes notebooks and scripts for model training, evaluation, and deployment, covering popular machine learning techniques.

- **R - Data Visualization**: This section includes resources and scripts in R dedicated to data visualization. It covers techniques and examples of creating insightful visualizations to represent data effectively.

- **Other Files**:
  - **.DS_Store**: A system file that can generally be ignored.
